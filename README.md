Court Case Service
==================
Service to access court cases imported from HMCTS Libra court lists

Dev Setup
---

In order to run the service locally, a postgres database is required, the easiest way to run locally is using the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file which will pull down the latest version.

```docker-compose up```

The service uses Lombok and so annotation processors must be [turned on within the IDE](https://www.baeldung.com/lombok-ide).

Building and running
---

This service is built using Gradle. In order to build the project from the command line, run

```./gradlew build```

To run the service, ensure there is an instance of Postgres running and then run

```./gradlew bootRun```

Dependencies
---
The service has an attached Postgres database as well as several back ends the details of which can be found in the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file.

To run against local Dockerised back-ends and database

```docker-compose up```

There are also Wiremock stubs for each of the back end calls which the `test` Spring profile runs against, to run these use the following command along with `docker-compose up`

```bash runMocks.sh```

### Default port
